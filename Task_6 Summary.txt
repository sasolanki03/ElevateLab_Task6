**Created 5 passwords with varying complexity:

-> hello123
-> Hello@123
->H@ckM3Plz2025
->S@f3P@ssw0rd!
->Gz8#K1@!Np$X7b

**Included character types: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols, and lengths from 8 to 14+.

**Tool used: security.org password checker

**Tested on password checkers:

-Weak: hello123 (easily guessable, low complexity)
-Strong: Gz8#K1@!Np$X7b (high entropy, resistant to brute force)

**Noted tool feedback:

-Suggestions to avoid dictionary words
-Tips to increase length and complexity

**Learned best practices:

-Use a mix of character types
-Avoid personal info
-Prefer 12+ characters
-Donâ€™t reuse old passwords

**Researched password attacks:

-Brute force: Try all combinations
-Dictionary: Try known/common words
-Credential stuffing: Use leaked passwords from data breaches

**Summarized:

-Longer, more complex passwords = more secure
-Strong passwords reduce risk of being cracked
